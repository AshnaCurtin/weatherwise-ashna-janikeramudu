#Option 1: Manual Upload to GitHub (Simple & recommended for you)
1	In Colab, go to File -> Download -> Download .ipynb
2	Save your notebook on your computer
3	Also prepare your README.md, reflection.txt, and ai-conversations/ files locally
4	On GitHub, go to your repository
5	Click Add file → Upload files
6	Drag and drop your notebook and all other files
7	Write a commit message like Upload starter_notebook and documents
8	Click Commit changes

#Option 2: Use Git Commands Inside Colab (Advanced)
You can run Git commands directly inside Colab (not necessary for you but possible).
Example:
python

!git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
!git config --global user.name "Your Name"
!git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-advisor.git
